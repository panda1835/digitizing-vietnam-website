The dictionary is systematically and scientifically structured into two columns: one column identifies the character form, pronunciation, and code of the character, while the other analyzes the structure of the Chữ Nôm character, provides its meaning, and includes relevant contextual examples. Special attention is given to the variations of Chữ Nôm characters, with each entry possibly having one or more variant forms that are clearly recorded from specific textual sources. This is a significant highlight of this dictionary.",
